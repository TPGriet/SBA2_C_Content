--------------------------------------------------------------------
/*  
From the top of a tower, an Indian army soldier sees his enemy on the ground at an angle of depression of θº in radians. 
If the tower is h feet in height, how far is the enemy from the base of the tower.

Hint: •	Convert angle to degrees in order to use inbuilt tan function available in math.h
•	tan (𝜃) = (ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡/𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)
•	Convert the degree to radians using 1 degree = 𝜋/180 radians
•	tan (0.7854 radians) = 1
